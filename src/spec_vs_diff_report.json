  "summary": "REQ-12 and REQ-13 appear to be addressed by (1) adding a top-level ThemeProvider usage in the app composition (as implied by the App.tsx changes) and (2) introducing an AppErrorBoundary that logs errors and renders an English fallback UI. Additionally, useTheme was updated to provide a defensive runtime fallback to prevent crashes if used outside ThemeProvider.",
